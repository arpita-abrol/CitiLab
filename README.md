# CitiLab

## Git / Bitbucket Lab 2020

## Outline
The objective of this lab is to become familiar with using git and bitbucket. In particular:
* Creating a dev branch for development work
* Creating feature branches for new work
* Creating a pull requests to merge work into “upstream” branches
* If there are merge conflicts you will need to merge manually e.g. using the gitbash command
line
## Instructions
1. Work in teams
2. Create a single bitbucket project, make it public so that your team and the instructors can all
access it.
3. You will add 1 file to your project – a README file
4. One team member should create a branch off the master branch called “dev”
5. Each team member should clone the repo and create their own feature branch off the dev branch

* git checkout dev
* git checkout –b feature/ YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
6. Each team member should push their feature branch to bitbucket
* git push –u origin feature/YOUR_BANCH_NAME
7. Each team member should create a pull request for their branch
8. Each team member should now make their own unique change to the README on their own
branch. Add, commit and push your change to your feature branch.
